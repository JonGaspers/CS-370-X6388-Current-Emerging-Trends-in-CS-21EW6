For this project, we were given this notebook mostly filled out, but the Q-learning algorithm was not added to allow the pirate agent learn and we had to fill in that algorithm. I wrote in the Q-learning algorithm to help the pirate agent learn how to pathfind to the treasure before the player. 


Computer scientists are scientists that use computer algorithms to solve problems. As more fields start using computers and storing their data on computers, it is ever more important for computer scientists to develop more efficient algorithms for processing that data. 

I approach problems as a computer scientist by first breaking it down into smaller problems, and start designing ways to simplify and solve the smaller problems, then slowly build up to the larger overall problem. 

My ethical responsibilities to the end user is to ensure their data is being stored, used and transmitted safely and securely, as well as being used for ethical purposes. My ethical responsibilities to the organization is roughly the same, the safe and secure use, storage and transmission of their sensitive data.
